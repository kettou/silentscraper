# [#f03c15]SilentScraper  `#f03c15`
SilentScraper is a cutting-edge web scraping solution designed for professionals. Built with advanced steal protocols, it operates undetectably in the background, bypassing anti-scraping mechanisms to collect structured data at scale. It's lightwight architecture mimics humans browsing patterns, rotating IP addresses, spoofing user agents, and more.

## 1. Setup
* Install Required Libraries
```
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml random httpx time aiohttp aiofiles asyncio roundrobin scrapy
```
* Prepare User-Agents and Proxy Text Files:
  * Obtain a list of proxies (free or paid) and store them inside the blank proxyList.txt file.
  * We have inlcuded a list of user-agents in the userAgents.txt file, however you can modify to your liking.


## Key Components

### Proxy Management:
* Uses a pool of proxies to distribute requests across multiple IP addresses.
* Rotate proxies to prevent IP blocking & rate limiting.

### User Agent Rotation:
* Uses a list of user-agents to mimic different browsers and devices.
* Rotate user-agents for each request to avoid detection.

### Error Handling:
* Handles common errors like HTTP errors, CAPTCHA's, and timeouts.
* Implement retries with exponetial backoff for failed attempts.

### Request Throttling:
* Adds delays between requests to mimic human behavior and avoid triggering rate limits.

### CAPTCHA Solving:
* Detects CAPTCHA's and utilizes a CAPTCHA solving tool or service such as 2CAPTCHA if needed.

### Data Parsing:
* Uses BeautifulSoup4 to parse HTML and extract relevant data
* Handle changes in Google's HTML structure gracefully.

### Pagination:
* Navigate through multiple pages of search results by modifying query parameters (e.g. start parameter)

### Data Storage:
* Store scraped data in a structured format selected by the user (e.g. CSV, JSON, or a database)

### Logging & Monitoring:
* Log important events (e.g. requests, errors) for debugging and monitoring.

### Ethical and Legal Compliance
* Respect Google's robots.txt file and terms of service.
* Avoid overloading Google's servers with excessive requests.
